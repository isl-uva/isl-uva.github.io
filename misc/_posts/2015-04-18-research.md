Manufacturing is entering a period of substantial innovation and change driven by digitization, increased integration of sensors into production equipment, increasingly available data, advances in robotics and automaton, and the “Internet of Things”. The combination of these advances provides unprecedented opportunities to develop new and better ways of doing manufacturing. Led by Dr. Chang, Intelligent System Lab has been working on the development of next-generation analytics and control frameworks for smart manufacturing powered by domain knowledge, advanced robotics, big data, IoT, and machine learning techniques.
