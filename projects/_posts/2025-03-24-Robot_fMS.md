Mobile robot-enabled manufacturing systems redefine industrial operations by introducing unparalleled flexibility and efficiency. Integrating autonomous mobile robots into manufacturing systems enhances adaptability to changing production needs, revolutionizes material handling, and offers improved safety in the workplace. These systems involve the integration of autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robots into manufacturing processes, offering dynamic adaptability to changing production requirements. In this project we develop a dynamic mathematical model for a flexible multi-stage manufacturing system employing mobile robots across various workstations. The integrated model considers workstations and mobile robots while accounting for random disruptions in robots.
