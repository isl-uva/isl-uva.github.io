Robotic tasks often require multiple manipula-
tors to enhance task efficiency and speed, but this increases
complexity in terms of collaboration, collision avoidance, and
the expanded state-action space. To address these challenges,
we propose a multi-level approach combining Reinforcement
Learning (RL) and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)
to generate adaptive, real-time trajectories for new tasks in
dynamic environments using a demonstration library. This
method ensures collision-free trajectory generation and ef-
ficient collaborative motion planning. We validate the ap-
proach through experiments in the PyBullet simulation en-
vironment with UR5e robotic manipulators.
